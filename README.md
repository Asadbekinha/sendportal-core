## Installation

If you would like to install SendPortal as a stand-alone application, please follow the [installation guide](https://sendportal.io/docs/v2/getting-started/installation).

If you would like to add SendPortal to an existing application, please follow the [package installation guide](https://sendportal.io/docs/v2/getting-started/package-installation).

## Upgrading

If you already have a copy of SendPortal v1 installed, please follow the [upgrade guide](https://sendportal.io/docs/v2/getting-started/upgrade-guide).

## Description

The core functionality of SendPortal is contained within the [SendPortal Core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core) package. If you would like to add SendPortal to an existing application that already handles user authentication, you only require [SendPortal Core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core).

The [SendPortal](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal) application acts as a wrapper around SendPortal Core. It handles user authentication and workspaces, allowing you to run your copy of SendPortal as a stand-alone application.
